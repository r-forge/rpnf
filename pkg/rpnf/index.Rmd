# Purpose of **rpnf**

**rpnf** is a collection of R functions for creating Point & Figure (P&F) charts and statistics for a given time series.

# Features of **rpnf**

**rpnf** allows the creation of P&F charts and statistics with the following features

* X/O status processing of time series with
    + configurable box size
    + configurable reversal 
    + linear/logarithmic scales
* Determiniation of next X/O or reversal O/X points 
* Buy/Sell status
* Buy/Sell signal detection, currently
    + Double Top/Bottom
    + Triple Top/Bottom
    + Bullish/Bearish signal
    + Bullish/Bearish catapult
    + etc.

# How to install **rpnf**

1. We are asuming you have R installed and working. If not please consult one of well written howto's. 
2. Go to the R console, or your favorite R-IDE (we recommend http://www.rstudio.com)
3. Install latest stable version of **rpnf** with
```
install.packages("rpnf")
```
4. **rpnf** is now installed, and you can continue with the getting started section.

#### Getting the latest development version from Rforge

If you want to use (for a good reason) the latest development version from Rforge, then you can install it with:
```
install.packages("rpnf", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
```

# How to get started with **rpnf**

Once **rpnf** is installed you can start using it by loading the library:

```{R}
library(rpnf) # Load rpnf library
```

A typical workflow for using **rpnf** consists of three steps:

* Preparing some time series data
* Determining the P&F statistics for this time series
* Plotting the P&F chart for this time series

### Getting some data

**rpnf** has some sample data built in:
```{R}
data(DOW)   # Load some example data
```
You can have a look at these data with ```str(DOW)``` or ```DOW```.

### Determining the P&F statistics

To determine the P&F statistics of a time series you use:
```{R}
pnfdata <- pnfprocessor(
  high=DOW$High,
  low=DOW$Low,
  date=DOW$Date,
  boxsize=1L,
  log=FALSE)
```

### Understanding the P&F statistics

The data.frame returned by ```pnfprocessor(...)``` is full of P&F statistics on the given time series. Every row consists of one observation on the time series, whereas columns have the following meaning:

* date      : the date of the observation in the time series
* high      : the high values of the time series at observation date
* low       : the low values of the time series at observation date
* boxnumber : boxnumber (integer) of the current chart status 
* column    : current column (integer) in the P&F chart
* status.xo : factor containing the current X or O status
* nextX     : threshold to reach in order to make an X. If latest status.xo is an O, then this is the reversal point.
* nextO     : threshold to reach in order to make an O. If latest status.xo is an X, then this is the reversal point.
* status.bs : factor containing the current Buy/Sell status of this observation
* lastNextX : highest value of the previous X-column. Used for Buy/Sell detection.
* lastNextO : lowest value of the previous O-column. Used for Buy/Sell detection.
* signal.bs : current P&F buy or sell signal, such as Double Top, etc.

This data.frame can be used either to do some statistical analysis,
or it can be used to generate plots.

### Generating P&F plots

Generating plots from a pnf data.frame can be achieved by:

```{R}
pnfplottxt(
  data = pnfdata,
  reversal = 3,
  boxsize = 1L,
  log = F)
```

Alternatively you can plot a graphical chart with:

```{R}
pnfplot(
  data = pnfdata,
  reversal = 3,
  boxsize = 1L,
  log = F)
```


# Support

If you need commerical support feel free to contact Sascha Herrmann <sascha.herrmann.consulting@gmail.com> for an offer. You can also request a new feature development there.

For non-commerical support please refer to the r-forge forums.

# Development roadmap

Our current focus is to develop a set of wrappers and extensions to **rpnf**, so that it gets easier to exploit the full functionality of **rpnf** for creating Bullish Percent, Relative Strenght Charts, and others.
